# Biodiversity is Politics

During three days, you will be immersed in the preparation and simulation of a debate concerning the interactions of scientific and technical controversies related to the measure, the prevention of, and the fight against biodiversity loss, but also the cultural, economical, political and social stakes that are deeply intertwined. You will learn and argue from an actor's point of view, that you will embody in an arena of lively discussions. This original pedagogical experience has been created and designed by the Center for the Exploration of Controversies of Sciences Po.

## 30 by 30, a conservation battleground

> Terrestrial (15%) and marine (7%) protected areas on Earth

In 2016, Edward Osborne Wilson, one of the scientists who coined and defined the concept of biodiversity in the 1980s, published a new book titled _Half-Earth_, stating that half of the Earth's surface should be designated a human-free natural reserve to preserve biodiversity. In April 2019, inspired by Wilson, a team of scientists specialised in nature conservation, wrote a paper delineating a new "Global Deal for Nature", that targets "30% of the Earth to be formally protected [...] by 2030". Since, several international organisations, such as the I, launched initiatives to of the UN Convention for Biological Diversity. Human activities, wilderness pristince anthropocene. Indigenous population, green colonialism.

Proposition for the Post-2020 Global Diversity Framework Target 3:
> Ensure that at least 30 per cent globally of land areas and of sea areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and its contributions to people, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
