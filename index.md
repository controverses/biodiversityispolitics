# Biodiversity is Politics

During three days, you will be immersed in the preparation and the simulation of a debate concerning the interactions of scientific and technical controversies related to the measure, the prevention of, and the fight against biodiversity loss, but also the cultural, economical, political and social stakes that are deeply intertwined. You will learn and argue from an actor's point of view, that you will embody in an arena of lively discussions. The following original pedagogical experience has been created and designed by the Center for the Exploration of Controversies of Sciences Po.

## 30 by 30, a conservation battleground

> Terrestrial (15%) and marine (7%) protected areas on Earth

In 2016, Edward Osborne Wilson, one of the scientists who coined the concept of biodiversity in the 1980s, published a new book titled _Half-Earth_, stating that half of the Earth's surface should be designated a human-free natural reserve to preserve biodiversity. In April 2019, inspired by Wilson, a team of scientists specialised in nature conservation, wrote a paper delineating a new "Global Deal for Nature", that targets a first step of "30% of the Earth to be formally protected [...] by 2030". Since then, several international organisations, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), have been launching initiatives to make this 30x30 goal a formally and globally shared objective. In June 2022, in Nairobi (Kenya), the following statement has been negociated by a working group of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD):

> _Initial proposition_: Ensure that at least 30 per cent globally of land areas and of sea areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and its contributions to people, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.
> 
> _Ongoing draft_: see [CBD - Draft Recommendation for the Post-2020 Global Diversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/36ac/ae16/ff8fc251490eaa3184c70c06/wg2020-04-crp-06-add1-en.pdf)

There is today no consensus on the 30x30 plan. If some actors find the initiative environmentally too radical, or on the contrary challenge the criteria to define protected areas, others criticize the underlining concept of fortress conservation, the outdated vision of nature thought as pristine wilderness, and its irrelevance in the Anthropocene. Some stakeholders even claim it to be a threat for human rights, as they remind that, historically, local and indigenous populations have been displaced, and sometimes even tortured or killed for the sake of nature conservation; they denounce a new form of green colonialism.

In December 2022, the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15), hosted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), will take place in Montreal (Canada). The debates about the relevance and the definition of the 30x30 inititative within the post-2020 global diversity framework should then be fierce. As [one of the main actors concerned by the issue](/biodiversityispolitics/actors), you are invited to participate in a roundtable of the working group that aims to settle the controversy.
