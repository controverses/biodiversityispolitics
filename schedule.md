The seminar teacher introduces the arena of debate and the list of actors and resources, then distributes the roles among eleven groups (usually of two, sometimes of three depending on the number of students enrolled in your class).

During this workshop, you work by group and discuss with the seminar teacher the position of the actor you will represent, and begin to list and explicit a series of arguments.

### 3 // Workshop on your role guidelines and embodiment
